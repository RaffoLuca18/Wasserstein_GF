This file contains the work carried on during the semester project for Spring 2025 at EPFL under the supervision of PostDoc. L.V.Santoro, within the Mathematical Statistics Chair @ EPFL. The objective is to give an overview of gradient flows in Wasserstein spaces, together with some applications, with a focus on intuition.

We suggest consulting the "manuscript" file for a better overview.
Alternatively, a brief presentation can be found in the "slides" file.
