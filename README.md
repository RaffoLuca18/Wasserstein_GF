This file contains the work carried on during Spring 2025 at EPFL. The objective is to give an overview of the geometric properties of Wasserstein spaces, together with some applications, with a focus on intuition.

The current state of the manuscript is around 60%. Some code will be added. Chapters about sampling, Langevin and JKO will be added.
